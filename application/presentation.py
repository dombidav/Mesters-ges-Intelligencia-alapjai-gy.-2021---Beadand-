    Fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence Assignment - Dombi Tibor DÃ¡vid - HL5U4V - 2021
    
    Python implementation of the following game:
    Some people want to get from one side of a bridge to the other. 
    Up to two people can cross the bridge at a time. 
    Each walk at a different speed. If two go at the same time, they will both walk at the slower person's pace. 
    A lamp is also required for the crossing. (You can't go through without a lamp.) 
    How do all of them get to the other side in a given time?
    
    Note: To run with the original numbers in the assignment, use default on each setting.
